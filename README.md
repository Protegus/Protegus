My name is Knight! I am a teenaged computer programmer. I've been programming in JavaScript for a few years now, and recently moved on over to Lua! I have developed full Discord bots (no longer in use) and backend frameworks for a couple web applications. Well, that's me. If you have any questions or want to talk, friend me on Discord: `Knight - I Hate Humanity#0001` Thanks :)
